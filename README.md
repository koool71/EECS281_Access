# EECS281_Access
View Readme for information 


Email me at jordanch@umich.edu if you want to recieve access to my EECS281 private repo. I can add you as a contributer so you can look over the projects inside the repo. Unfortunatly I have to keep it private since there are sensitive class materials in that repo that could potentionally be looked at by current students getting me, and them, in a lot of trouble with our academic board.
